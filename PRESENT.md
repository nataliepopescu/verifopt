# Sketch Presentation for VERIFOPT

Goal: use verification at to extract performance, code size, or even energy optimizations

propagate info from (successful) verification to the compiler
- might be sufficient for triggering certain existing optimizations
- but may also require new optimization passes (TBD)

how do existing tools propagate static info to the compiler?
