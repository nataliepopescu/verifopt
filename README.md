# Verification for Compiler Optimization Project

Using verification / static analysis for optimizing code

## Repo structure

[flux-examples](https://github.com/nataliepopescu/verifopt/tree/main/flux-examples):
simplified code to use flux on, mirroring the kinds of constructs we would like
to verify in the real world

[meetings](https://github.com/nataliepopescu/verifopt/tree/main/meetings): notes 
from various meetings on verifopt / related things

[verus-examples](https://github.com/nataliepopescu/verifopt/tree/main/verus-examples):
simplified code to use verus on, mirroring the kinds of constructs we would like
to verify in the real world

[NOTES.md](https://github.com/nataliepopescu/verifopt/blob/main/NOTES.md): general 
project notes (high-level)

[PANICS.md](https://github.com/nataliepopescu/verifopt/blob/main/PANICS.md): notes
