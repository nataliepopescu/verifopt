how can the compiler provide certain feedback to user about what it could/couldn't do

recent work: structuring compiler output as an argument
- presents two/three options of what programmer can do and what the tradeoffs are
- TODO ask for link to this work

should the compiler modify source code?
- i.e. if compiler identifies an invariant, can it mod source code to warn user 
if at some point the invariant becomes violated

excited about work that makes compiler less of a black box
- have some way of controlling what it does without needing to modify source code 
- other ways to communicate info to the compiler
