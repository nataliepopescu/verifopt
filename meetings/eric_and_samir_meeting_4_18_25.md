# eric and samir meeting

## agenda

- [x] general project direction(s)
    - verus-related project
    - but might be putting that on the backburner for a bit
    - other projs

- [x] talk about the toy bounds checking verification efforts (verus vs flux)

- [x] ask about their experience w verus vs flux

- [x] what are they working on?

## notes

compile-time `assert` is possible
- mess around w loop
  - invariants might not be getting generated internally
  - apparently this is hardcoded in flux
