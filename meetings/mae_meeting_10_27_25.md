# meeting

dynamic trait objects
- easy to create a new variant
- hard/invasive to extend functionality

enums
- hard/invasive to create a new variant
- easy to extend functionality

visitor pattern
- sort of a hybrid approach between enums and trait objects
- written to solve the "expression problem": https://wiki.c2.com/?ExpressionProblem

TODO
- look into why struct_fields results are so weird/spread out
- also maybe remove last ~three tests
