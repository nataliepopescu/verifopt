## agenda

- stuck getting MIR (in particular, func defs) of dependent crates
    1. technical issues getting Callback-based crate to compile w our custom
       rustc
    2. even if we _were_ to get it to compile, would it still be possible to get
       all dep MIR in this way? according to a bjorn comment in the latest zulip
       thread it might not be? (comment confused me)
