# mae meeting

questions: 

- [ ] interp should eventually spit out 3 things
    - [x] store
    - [ ] expression returned
        - if anything (at this point, nothing i think)
    - [ ] string of program text
        - presumably with the funcptr -> conditional/switch rewrite?
        - hinges on switch statement impl BUT for now can have an optimized
          version when only two options? 

- [ ] is a funcptr the same as a funcdef? (at least in my code?)
    - i think right now they are the same thing
    - what would it mean/look like for them to be different?
