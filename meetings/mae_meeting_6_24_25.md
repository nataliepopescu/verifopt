# notes

eta abstraction
- i.e. summaries
- compositional approach
- not crucial for this project to satisfy eta abstractions

- some things in funcs don't work
    - moving something out of a var, now invalid

- loops/conditionals may allow more behavior than func boundaries (thus
  potentially more complicated)

- req: written once + called mult times
    - conditions dont satisfy this
    - functions/loops do


learned vs done
- add/remove lessons
- keep things that we've done

to test
- come up w a lot of patterns of testing and assigning

test case that demonstrates the difference between (1) merging learned/done, and
(2) keeping learned/done separate


conditionals vs SSA
- separate declaration vs assignment
- new node: declaration operation
    - must handle case where declared but not assigned (option type)
