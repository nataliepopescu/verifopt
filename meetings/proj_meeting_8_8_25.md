# meeting

## agenda

- compiled ~general list of cases where vtables are generated (at least in the 
  LLVM IR, may eventually want to confirm in binaries): 
  https://github.com/nataliepopescu/verifopt/blob/main/PATTERNS.md

- implementation now generally has everything sketched out
    - except for (maybe): sources of uncertainty (function summaries
      simplification)
