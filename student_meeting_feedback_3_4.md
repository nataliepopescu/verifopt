# Student Meeting Feedback for Verifopt
- get an example that's a bit more air tight than the panic removal
	- could replace panic with infinite loop
	- are devices that resource constrained?
- how will this look in the end?
	- a tool
	- we took a system and verified it
- given a goal of what the optimized output should be, how can you generate properties to verify?
	- a way to extract the verification condition
	- anti-patterns as a library that we can automatically remove
- Want to be wary about whether the output is more than marginally better
	- the compiler already does so much for you
	- unclear how much of a win you actually get
- what info *actually* informs the compiler to do more... since compilers are already so smart and do so much
- compilers can benefit from intention
- verification will surpass the what the compiler can do when instrumented with meaningful info.
	- so this is difficult because
		- how do you know what's meaningful
		- how do you know the benefit will be actual surpassing?
- often times verified systems are actually *not* optimized!
- look at Verus and RustBelt
